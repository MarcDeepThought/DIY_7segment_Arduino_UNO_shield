## Material list:

- [ ] Arduino UNO
- [ ] 4X6 prototype PCB (printed circuit board) Universal Board
- [ ] 2x 7 segment display
- [ ] 2x 330Î© resistors
- [ ] edge connector
- [ ] copper wire


### Hints:
1. When soldering the edge connecter, make sure, that you bend the pins connected to the pcb board a little bit. This is necessary for the digital pins 8-13, because the gap between pin 7 and 8 on the Arduino UNO board is less than one connector pin.
2. When ordering the 7 segment display, be aware, that there are parts with a common anode (CA) or common cathode (CC).
3. When soldering the copper wire, it is not necessary to solder every single eye on the PCB.
4. The circuit design has been created with Tiny CAD Version 2.90.00 Build #686 Production Release.
